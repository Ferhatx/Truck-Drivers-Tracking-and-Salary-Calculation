# Truck Driver ERP System

This project was developed in response to a set of challenges faced by a company employing truck drivers. The company had the following issues:

## Problem Statement

1. The company maintained a list of 50 truck drivers only by name and surname in an Excel sheet.
2. Drivers were paid based on their working hours, with different pay rates for overtime.
3. Working on holidays and weekends triggered different pay rates.
4. Monthly work schedules excluded Sundays and official holidays, and this was factored into salary calculations.
5. There was no system to manage or record annual leave requests.

All operations were previously managed through Excel spreadsheets, which became increasingly complex as the number of drivers grew. The company requested an online system that could be accessed at any time.

After consulting with the company, I proposed developing a web-based system.
